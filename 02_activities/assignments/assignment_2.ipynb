Also, while those print statements are great for debugging, they would need removal for production use since they slow processing.\n",

When we discussed it, we agreed that removing that unnecessary conditional would streamline the code without hurting performance.

Working together helped us both improve our solutions and understand the algorithm more deeply through shared perspective and technical discussion of our methods."
